# EI_Integration_Engine
POC: Epi Info Message Integration Engine

The program is a proof-of-concept.

Currently, it allows the user to read in an HL7 2.x.x message.  When the message is read in, it is immediately converted to XML, JSON, and FHIR.

The FHIR message structure may not be 100% accurate.  Updates will happen the more information gathered on converting HL7 2.x.x messages to FHIR.
